# EDA-Women-in-DS
The objective of this project is to understand the nature of women's representation in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning using exploratory data analysis of a survey provided by Kaggle titled "Kaggle ML & DS Survey Challenge". 
The second part of this project is to use the information present in the survey to train, validate, and tune multi-class ordinal classification models that can predict a survey respondentâ€™s current yearly compensation bucket, based on a set of survey responses by a data scientist. This is done using Ordinal Logistic Regression.
